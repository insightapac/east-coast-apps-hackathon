# Insight Apps & Integration Hackathon
Welcome to the Insight Apps & Integration Hackathon. You can use any language, framework, libraries and tools you wish, just note in your solution if it's not included in the code you submit. You can also include a brief explanation of your design and any assumptions you made, along with your solution. Weâ€™d like you to demonstrate your solution design and development skills, and are interested in how you approached the problem, and what alternatives you considered. 

## Build an API
You are a developer for a company (ServerHosting Co) and have been tasked with developing a web-service that will provide server status data for another company (XYZ Co) to consume. You need to provide a functioning web-service to serve the data for consumption by XYZ Co. The data should include a list of servers and whether they were online or offline at a particular time (this data can be faked but should be stored & retrieved from some form of storage).

## Build a UI

You are a developer for a company (XYZ Co) and you are writing a small web application that shows the status of the servers that host your software. You need to integrate with the Server API provided by (ServerHosting Co) to get this information. The information should be presented in an application that can be accessed on a wide variety of devices and screen sizes. Ideally this data should stay as up to date as possible.
